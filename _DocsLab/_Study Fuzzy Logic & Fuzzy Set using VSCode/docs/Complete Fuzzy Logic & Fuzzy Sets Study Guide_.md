## 🌟 Introduction

### What is Fuzzy Logic?

Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic that deals with reasoning that is approximate rather than fixed and exact. Unlike classical logic where variables may only be true or false (1 or 0), fuzzy logic allows for degrees of truth.

### Why Learn Fuzzy Logic?

- **Real-world modeling**: Handle uncertainty and imprecision
- **Control systems**: Temperature controllers, washing machines, automotive systems
- **Decision making**: AI, expert systems, pattern recognition
- **Industry applications**: Manufacturing, robotics, consumer electronics

### Prerequisites

- Basic programming (Python or Rust)
- High school mathematics
- Understanding of logic and sets
- Curiosity and patience!
